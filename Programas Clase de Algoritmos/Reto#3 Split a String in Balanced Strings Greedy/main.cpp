  Reto#3 Split a String in Balanced Strings Greedy

 Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
 Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.
 Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.

 Example 1:
 Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
 Output: 4
 Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

 Example 2:
 Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
 Output: 3
 Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

 Example 3:
 Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
 Output: 1
 Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".

 Example 4:
 Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
 Output: 2
 Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", since each substring contains an equal number of 'L' and 'R'

 Constraints:
 1 <= s.length <= 1000
 s[i] = 'L' or 'R'
