 Hard

 A chef has collected data on the satisfaction level of his n dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.
 Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level  i.e.  time[i]*satisfaction[i]
 Return the maximum sum of Like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation.
 Dishes can be prepared in any order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.


 Example 1:
 Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9]
 Output: 14
 Explanation: After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total Like-time coefficient will be equal to (-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14). Each dish is prepared in one unit of time.

 Example 2:
 Input: satisfaction = [4,3,2]
 Output: 20
 Explanation: Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20)

 Example 4:
 Input: satisfaction = [-2,5,-1,0,3,-3]
                        5,3,0,-1,-2,-3
 Output: 35
